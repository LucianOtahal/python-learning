# 🐍 Python Learning

**Python Learning** is my personal notebook of exercises, notes, and mini projects as I learn Python. It's designed to help beginners and serve as a future reference for myself.  
The content covers Python basics, data analysis, and visualization — all written in Jupyter notebooks.

## 💡 How It Started

At first, I was pretty lost when choosing the right tool. There are so many options, and I had no idea what to base my decision on.  
I tried a few environments and gradually figured out what works best for me:

- **Jupyter Notebook** – like a digital notebook: write code, see results instantly, add notes, charts… perfect for learning and analysis.
- **VS Code** – like a modular toolkit: lightweight, customizable, great for experimenting beyond notebooks.
- **PyCharm** – like a professional workshop: everything is built-in, but it can feel heavy and overwhelming for simple tasks.

Now I use **Jupyter Notebook** for learning and documenting, and **VS Code** for further experimentation and playing with libraries.
